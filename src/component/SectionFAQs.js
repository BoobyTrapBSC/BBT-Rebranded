                                <div className="accordion-body">Almost everyone in DEFI space has been scammed or got trapped in a rug pull in one way or the other. So, this team has taken the onus on themselves to come up with a platform where you will get all the legit DEVS (with KYC), list of their successful projects and also upcoming ones with jaw dropping details, doxxed Influencers and service providers at one platform. Investors will be able to rate the projects, Devs, Service Providers, Influencers & promoters with 'TRAP Points' from 0-10, with 0 trap points meaning extremely safe, 1-2 being safe, 3-5 being moderate, and 5-9 being dangerous, and 10 being extremely dangerous. The rating ecosystem will be built on blockchain, thus being immutable and transparent.
